 Requirements and how I've satisfied them:
     running at least three threads, with at least two different thread functions (or two different tasks, in a task-based system)
         Thread(s) 1: threads[i] (compute, line 219)
         Thread 2: timeWriteThread (write_time, line 221)
         Thread 3: Arguable - Main thread, write_tga (line 240)
     sharing resources safely between threads (e.g. using mutexes, atomic operations or barriers)
         Mutexes:
             Declared - Line 24
             Used - Lines 135, 137, 223
         Atomic Variables:
             Declared - Line 25
             Used - Lines 133, 224
     signalling between threads (e.g. using semaphores, channels or condition variables)
         Conditional Variables:
             Declared: Line 26
             Used: Lines 135, 225
